# Hotels_EDA_project
🚀 Excited to share my latest data cleaning, SQL integration, and Power BI visualization project! 🚀 I've been working on a dataset of Hotels , and here's how I tackled the challenge:
# **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**
  I began by loading the data into Jupyter using Pandas for initial inspection, cleaning, and preprocessing to prepare it for further analysis.

# **SQL Integration:**
  Once the data was cleaned, I established a connection between Jupyter and SQL. The data was then transferred into an existing table in my SQL database.

# **Data Transfer & Chunking:**
  To ensure efficient loading, I used data chunking while transferring the dataset to the SQL database, allowing for smooth processing and avoiding overload.

# **Pipeline Creation:**
  I created an automated pipeline for the seamless flow of data from Jupyter to SQL, ensuring that the data could be easily refreshed and processed in stages. 




# **Power BI Visualization:**
  After the data was successfully loaded into SQL, I connected Power BI to the database. From there, I imported the data and utilized Power BI’s advanced visualization features to          generate insightful reports.

# **Report:**
  Using Power BI, I created interactive and detailed reports that highlighted key insights from the dataset. These reports provide a comprehensive overview of trends and patterns in the    data.
  


📊 Outcome: The project helped me refine my skills in data cleaning, SQL integration, and visualization, resulting in meaningful insights from the suicide bombing dataset. Looking forward to tackling more projects like this!
